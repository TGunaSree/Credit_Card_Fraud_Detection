💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It analyzes transaction data to identify patterns and classify whether a transaction is legitimate or fraud.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Dataset

284,807 transactions

492 frauds (highly imbalanced)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

🧠 Methodology
Data cleaning and scaling

Handling class imbalance using undersampling or SMOTE

Model training and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

✅ Results
Achieved high accuracy and recall using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
